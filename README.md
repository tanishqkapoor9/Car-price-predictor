# Car-price-predictor
 The Car Price Prediction project uses a Linear Regression model to estimate car prices based on brand, model, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. After cleaning the dataset, the model is trained and deployed via a Flask web app. Users enter car details in a form, and the app returns the predicted price, showcasing complete model deployment.
